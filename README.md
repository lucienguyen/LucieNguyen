## Hi there 👋

I'm Lucie, a Master's student in Life Science Technologies 🌱 at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en). My major is Complex Systems, a field that applies data science 📈, computer science 💻, and mathematics 📚 to understand emergent behaviors in interconnected systems. I am particularly interested in applying complex systems approaches to model and analyze life science networks 🧑‍🔬.

### My recent projects:
- [Bachelor's thesis](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/items/9d6aa2aa-ba45-4160-ab13-c68de4e25cf1) about AI application in prediction of enzyme-substrate interactions of aromatic metabolic enzymes from white-rot fungi.

- Analyzing cortisol and melatonin levels based on sleep and activity data: [Sleep-Analysis](https://github.com/lucienguyen/sleep-analysis-dhhb25)



🎨 Apart from study, graphic design is one of my fascination. See some of my work here and please take a look at my [Behance gallery](https://www.behance.net/lucienguyen5) for more 🥰.
