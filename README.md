## Hi there 👋

I'm Lucie, a Master's student in Life Science Technologies 🌱 at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en). My major is Complex Systems, a field that applies data science 📈, computer science 💻, and mathematics 📚 to understand emergent behaviors in interconnected systems. I am particularly interested in applying complex systems approaches to model and analyze life science networks 🧑‍🔬.

### My recent projects:
- Analyze cortisol and melatonin levels based on sleep and activity data: [Sleep-Analysis](https://github.com/lucienguyen/sleep-analysis-dhhb25)


### My design work:
Apart from study, graphic design is one of my fascination. See some of my work here and please take a look at my [Behance gallery](https://www.behance.net/lucienguyen5) for more 🥰.

If you are interest in collaboration, please contact me through [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/uyen-nguyen-lan/) or email.
